<h1> This page is "hidden" </h1>

This is hidden in the sense that if you don't have a link to it or know what the 
file structure and filename is. Then, you won't be able to find it. 

If the website is hosted on Github, then in theory, people will be able to find it. 
But, they will need to dig through to find it (high effort).
